    <short_description>A YouTube video player.</short_description>
    <long_description>WiiTube is intended to be an update Youtube Video player for the Wii. Basic functionality such as searching and playing videos is supported. More advanced functionality such as viewing channels or playing playlists isn't an explicit goal, however will be happily merged if PR'd.
